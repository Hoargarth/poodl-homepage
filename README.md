# Installation
`$ composer install` to install all php dependencies / framework
`$ npm install` to install JS dependencies (tested with node version 14)

# Development
**Start local PHP development server:** (assuming you have installed symfony cli)
`$ symfony server:start`
-> The terminal will tell you the ip + port to visit. In general it is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

**JS/SCSS Watcher:**
`npm run dev-server` to watch and compile file changes (JS/SCSS/VUE)
