            'history' : 'A Bit of History',
            'historyTextblock' : 'POODL was created by a group of developers that decided to run the project like most meme-coins, pumped it, dumped it, and then abandoned it. This left the community in a rather difficult situation.<br/><br/>Most tokens are simply left for dead after the first pump and dump, but POODL survived because the community saw potential in it and together, started a Telegram group to revive it. Pretty quickly people got interested in the project and the community started to grow exponentially.<br/><br/>After reviving the token, creating an official site, and all of the necessary infrastructure, the community began to question where to go from here. Liquidity from the original developers was locked until May 2nd, which was weeks away. What could be done to prevent a rug pull? A bridge? No, because the original dev could just move along with everyone else and dump on the new network. Eventually it was decided that the best move was to airdrop a new token to our existing holders. It was a risky move, but it was done just in time.<br/><br/>On April 25th, every existing holder was airdropped the new token, matching their existing holdings of the old token. The new token was on BSC, partially due to community demand, but also because Eth gas fees were soaring in cost at the time of the transition. BSC was the best solution at the time.<br/><br/>On May 2nd, the original developers returned, as some had feared, and attempted to rug pull the old erc20 token. They almost completely succeeded, save for some liquidity that was provided by community members. This ensured that people still had a way out, if they wished to trade the erc20 token, but it did not impact the new token at all. Everyone was safe at last.<br/><br/>Once Poodl was back on solid ground, it was time to begin building utility. Time to grow up and move beyond being a simple meme token. A community voting system was put in place, allowing anyone holding Poodl to vote on important project related issues or initiatives. Then Poodl began seeking out other legitimate projects to partner with. After finding a few, work started on our own utility.<br/><br/>The story continues.',
            'versionTwo' : 'v2.0',
            'versionTwoTextblock' : 'As mentioned, the POODL contract was abandoned, but whoever did it took the keys. This presented limitations that put the community at risk, most importantly because when the liquidity unlocks, the rug can be pulled leaving all holders stranded. Contract ownership also gives us the ability to implement tokenomics that further protect smaller holders from big dumps that affect the price so much.<br/><br/>POODL v1.0 was successful only because of the community around it and the restless effort of the admins, who work 24/7 to ensure the long-term continuity of this project. In a short span of 1 month, we built all social channels, a new website, we were audited, filed a trademark, listed on several exchanges. This gives us the confidence to take POODL to the next level in its new version on BSC.',

We all have contributed time and resources to create music, memes, official merchandise, NFTs, applications and much more.<br/><br/>Further, POODLâs goal is not just making the token valuable and its holders monetarily happy, but sharing its success with those who need most. We have active partnerships with charities which we donate to as POODL grows.<br/><br/>POODL is here to stay, if you follow official announcements you will not be disappointed with the constant stream of new developments taking place.',
